# DiamondPrice_Prediciton

Project Description:
This project was developed as part of a Machine Learning workshop. It analyzes a dataset of diamonds to uncover patterns in their pricing and builds a predictive model using machine learning techniques. The project offers insights into the factors that influence diamond prices and demonstrates the application of ML algorithms for regression tasks.

Features
	•	Data preprocessing and cleaning for diamond-related features.
	•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations for better insights.
	•	Implementation of a Linear Regression model for price prediction.
	•	Model evaluation using metrics like R² and Mean Squared Error.

Dataset

Source:
The dataset (diamonds.csv) contains details about over 53,000 diamonds with the following key features:
	•	carat: Weight of the diamond.
	•	cut: Quality of the cut (e.g., Ideal, Premium).
	•	color: Diamond color grading.
	•	clarity: Measure of internal defects.
	•	price: Price of the diamond in USD.
	•	depth, table, x, y, z: Dimensions and proportions.
